## About the Video Course
Many apps allow users to log in to popular social networks such as Twitter and Facebook. iOS used to allow authenticating with these services on a system level but that has since changed. In this course, you will learn how to work both with Twitter and Facebook to make your app that much easier for users to work with.

We start with Twitter and discuss how to set up your application with Twitter's API. Then we move on o authenticating users with Twitter so that you can access user data. We'll then create an app called Tweetgram, where we download images from a user's Twitter feed.

Finally, you'll explore the Facebook API. Step by step, you'll install it and integrate it into your project. You'll then explore how to get data from the Facebook API.
